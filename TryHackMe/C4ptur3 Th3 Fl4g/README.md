### [Task 2] Hashes

A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size onto data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hashcodes, digests, or simply hashes. Crack the following hashes to reveal the answers. Hashcat  bruteforce is probably the easiest way to complete this challenge, or try CyberChef and md5hasing.net if you want to go easy-mode. Reference this website for known hash types

### [Task 3] Spectrograms

A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls. 

●  Download the file : `Super Secret Message`

### [Task 4] Steganography

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

●  Decode the image to reveal the answer. : `SpaghettiSteg`

### [Task 5] Security through obscurity

Security through obscurity is the reliance in security engineering on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.

●  Download and get 'inside' the file. What is the first filename & extension? : `hackerchat.png`

●  Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text. : `"AHH_YOU_FOUND_ME!"`
