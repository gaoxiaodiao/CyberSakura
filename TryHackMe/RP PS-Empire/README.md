#3	What command can we now type to view all of the options related to our selected listener type? : `info`

#4	Once the information regarding the listener pops up, peruse this for some of the more interesting options we can set in order to disguise our actions more. Which option can we use to set specific times when our listener will be active? : `WorkingHours`

#5	Similar to changing/spoofing what browser you are using on the internet, what option can we set to appear as a different user agent (i.e. chrome, firefox, etc)? : `DefaultProfile`

#9	We can verify that our listener is now active by typing what command? : `listeners`

### [Task 4] Stagers

#1	First, type the command 'usestager' and double-tap tab to view all options we have for stagers. Which option allows us to use a batch file? : `windows/launcher_bat`

#2	Let's finish our previous command and select the batch file option. Press enter to finalize this. What is our new path to the 'module' we have selected? : `stager/windows/launcher_bat`

#3	Since we've previously set our listener to use http, we must now set the associated options within our stager we are building to match that. What option must we set in order to accomplish this? : `Listener`

#4	Type execute to finish creating our stager. Where is the stager saved? : `/tmp/launcher.bat`

#8	We'll start with the most important module, find the module which plays a specific AC/DC song. : `python/trollsploit/osx/thunderstruck`

#9	What if we wanted to perform an lsa dump with a certain popular windows credential gathering tool? : `powershell/credentials/mimikatz/lsadump`

#10	Sometime we might not have the permissions level that we require to perform further actions, what module set might we have to use to get around UAC? : `bypassuac`

#11	What module family allows us to gather additional information about the network we are on? : `recon`

#12	Our process we have compromised might not be the most stable, how do we migrate to another process? (This will have a specific module answer) : `powershell/management/psinject`
