```

## Deployment

None required.

## Solution

1. The word ‘substitute’ in the challenge statement suggests that the characters have been encrypted using monoalphabetic substitution cipher. 
2. Decrypt with monoalphabetic substitution cipher at https://www.dcode.fr/monoalphabetic-substitution, alphabet: `HECGPSUORAQYKFDLIZJNXMVBTW`, and the flag will be `CYS{CYBERYOUTHSINGAPOREISAMAZING}`.
