# No comment

You have the right to remain silent, whatever you comment may be held against you.

## Deployment

Use a static file server to serve the `website` directory.

## Solution

View the source code of the page. There's a commented-out link in the `nav` that links to `/admin.html`. Visit that page and the flag is visible within the `textarea`. It is `CYS{incriminating_comments}`.
