Nie jest to cezar ani nic podobnego, ale wygląda na jakiś szyfr podstawny. Po chwili kombinowania, postanawiamy wrzucić to do jakiegoś [odpowiedniego solvera](http://quipqiup.com/index.php), z dobrym skutkiem:

    BUT NO, IT WAS A SHORT CUT TO SOMETHING BIGGER. SOMETHING GRANDER. SOMETHING
    BEAUTIFUL. WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US. BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN
    LOOKING AT WHAT'S ABOVE US.

Mamy flagę i 50 punktów

It doesn't seem to be a Caesar cipher or anything of this sort, however it does look like a substitution cipher. After a while trying to crack it up we decide to upload the input to an [online cipher solver](http://quipqiup.com/index.php), with good results:

    BUT NO, IT WAS A SHORT CUT TO SOMETHING BIGGER. SOMETHING GRANDER. SOMETHING
    BEAUTIFUL. WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US. BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN
    LOOKING AT WHAT'S ABOVE US.

We have the flag and 50 points.
