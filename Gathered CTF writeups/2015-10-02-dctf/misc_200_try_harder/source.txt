Capture the	Flag (CTF)	is a special	kind	of information	security	competitions. There are	three common	types of	CTFs:	Jeopardy, Attack-Defence and mixed.	
<br/>Jeopardy-style	CTFs has	a	couple of	questions	(tasks)	in	range of	categories.	For example,	Web,	Forensic,	Crypto, Binary or	something	else. Team can	gain some points for every	solved task. More points for more complicated	tasks	usually.	The next task in chain can	be	opened only after some team	solve previous	task.	Then	the game time	is over sum	of	points	shows you	a CTF winer. Famous example	of such CTF is Defcon CTF quals.	
<br/>Well,	attack-defence is	another interesting kind	of competitions.	Here	every team	has	own	network(or only one host)	with vulnarable services. Your team has time	for	patching your	services	and developing	exploits usually.	So,	then organizers	connects participants of	competition and	the	wargame	starts! You should	protect	own red	herring	for defence points and	hack	opponents for attack	points.	Historically this is	a first type of	CTFs,	everybody knows about DEF CON CTF -	something	like a World Cup of all	other	competitions.	
<br/>Mixed competitions may vary possible formats.	It	may be something like wargame	with special	time	for	task-based elements (like	UCSB iCTF). 
<br/>CTF	games	often	touch on	many other aspects of information	security:	cryptography, stego, binary	analysis, reverse engeneering, mobile	security and	others.	Good	teams generally have	strong	skills	and	experience in	all these issues.
