In this task we were given two files, the server binary and libc installed on their system.

The binary was listening on port 1337 and allowing a simple team creation when connected to. Example session:

The bug in the implementation was that when you selected a player and then removed him, you were still able to
modify his details, such as changing his name. By carefully selecting name lengths to allocate specific amounts
of memory, we were able to make deleted, but still selected, player's name pointer controlled - in my case,
I pointed it to GOT's `free` entry. Then I sent the 'change name' command, allowing to overwrite free pointer with
a `system` pointer (offsets between these dumped from supplied libc). The rest was simple - free another player's
name, whose name was actually a bash command. Listing the directory showed us flag file immediately.
