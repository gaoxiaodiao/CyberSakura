# Patience (RE, 769p)

This was a haskell reversing challenge. If this doesn't fill you with dread, this means that probably either:

- you are most 1338 pr0 xakep r3v3rse engineer ever living
- you don't comprehend the amount of horror that you're going to witness.

Either way, you're in for some serious fun. In fact, I've never seen anyone actually reverse engineer (non-trivial) haskell binary before - most challenges are actually solved with black-box workarounds or other side channels. This task is no different - we are given .cmm file along with compiled binary.

CMM files are dump of late-stage intermediate language from GHC. This is going to make our life way easier - we don't have to reverse haskell thunks, we have everything in plain text... well, sort of.

## How to be lazy

A word of introduction to the beautiful world of functional programming. Haskell is a lazy language. But not just your average slightly-procrastinating kind - everything is delayed as long as it possibly can be, and I mean it. For example, consider this function:

```haskell
integers n = n : integers (n+1)
```

if you don't speak Haskell, this is conceptually equivalent to following python code:

```python
def integers(n):
    return [n] + integers(n + 1)
```

Do you see anything wrong with this code? Exactly, this is not a terribly useful function - it'll recurse forever, or rather eat all your available stack space and explode. Not in Haskell though - you can call this function, take first 100 elements of the result, and get perfectly useful result - haskell is *lazy*, so only necessary elements will be evaulated.

But this still doesn't explain just how lazy Haskell is. Consider this:

```haskell
foo (2 + 2)
```

This is just invoaction of function `foo` with parameter `4`. Wait, wrong, I lied to you. The parameter is `2 + 2`, and it's not actually evaluated until it's needed. Hell, you could've passed `1 / 0` and nothing bad would happen, at least until something actually evaulates the parameter.

## Reversing

So, why the introduction? Well, this is how `main` function looks like in dump:

```
==================== Output Cmm ====================
[section ""data" . :Main.main_closure" {
     :Main.main_closure:
         const :Main.main_info;
         const 0;
         const 0;
         const 0;
 },
 :Main.main_entry() //  [R1]
         { info_tbl: [(c3bb,
                       label: :Main.main_info
                       rep:HeapRep static { Thunk })]
           stack_info: arg_space: 8 updfr_space: Just 8
         }
     {offset
       c3bb:
           _01D::P64 = R1;
           if ((Sp + 8) - 24 < SpLim) goto c3bc; else goto c3bd;
       c3bc:
           R1 = _01D::P64;
           call (stg_gc_enter_1)(R1) args: 8, res: 0, upd: 8;
       c3bd:
           (_c3b8::I64) = call "ccall" arg hints:  [PtrHint,
                                                    PtrHint]  result hints:  [PtrHint] newCAF(BaseReg, _01D::P64);
           if (_c3b8::I64 == 0) goto c3ba; else goto c3b9;
       c3ba:
           call (I64[_01D::P64])() args: 8, res: 0, upd: 8;
       c3b9:
           I64[Sp - 16] = stg_bh_upd_frame_info;
           I64[Sp - 8] = _c3b8::I64;
           R2 = Main.main_closure;
           R1 = GHC.TopHandler.runMainIO_closure;
           Sp = Sp - 16;
           call stg_ap_p_fast(R2, R1) args: 24, res: 0, upd: 24;
     }
 }]
```

Beautiful, isn't it? What's going on here? Nothing, actually. All this code does is:

```haskell
runMainIO (main_closure)
```

where `main_closure` is well, closure from main. Let's dig deeper - what's inside this `main_closure`?

```haskell
Main.main_entry() //  [R1]
        { info_tbl: [(c3aW,
                      label: Main.main_info
                      rep:HeapRep static { Thunk })]
          stack_info: arg_space: 8 updfr_space: Just 8
        }
    {offset
      c3aW:
          _rFG::P64 = R1;
          if ((Sp + 8) - 24 < SpLim) goto c3aX; else goto c3aY;
      c3aX:
          R1 = _rFG::P64;
          call (stg_gc_enter_1)(R1) args: 8, res: 0, upd: 8;
      c3aY:
          (_c3aT::I64) = call "ccall" arg hints:  [PtrHint,
                                                   PtrHint]  result hints:  [PtrHint] newCAF(BaseReg, _rFG::P64);
          if (_c3aT::I64 == 0) goto c3aV; else goto c3aU;
      c3aV:
          call (I64[_rFG::P64])() args: 8, res: 0, upd: 8;
      c3aU:
          I64[Sp - 16] = stg_bh_upd_frame_info;
          I64[Sp - 8] = _c3aT::I64;
          R5 = sat_s2Rj_closure+1;
          R4 = sat_s2Rf_closure;
          R3 = GHC.Base.$fMonadIO_closure;
          R2 = Data.Foldable.$fFoldable[]_closure;
          R1 = Data.Foldable.forM__closure;
          Sp = Sp - 16;
          call stg_ap_pppp_fast(R5,
                                R4,
                                R3,
                                R2,
                                R1) args: 24, res: 0, upd: 24;
    }                                               
}                                                   
```

Again, a lot of code. And again, This is equivalent to:

```haskell
forM (s2Rj_closure) (s2Rf_closure)
```

So, invocation of single function with two closures.

And again...

```haskell
==================== Cmm produced by new codegen ====================
[section ""data" . sat_s2Rf_closure" {
     sat_s2Rf_closure:
         const sat_s2Rf_info;
         const 0;
         const 0;
         const 0;
 },
 sat_s2Rf_entry() //  [R1]
         { info_tbl: [(c3aH,
                       label: sat_s2Rf_info
                       rep:HeapRep static { Thunk })]
           stack_info: arg_space: 8 updfr_space: Just 8
         }
     {offset
       c3aH:
           _s2Rf::P64 = R1;
           goto c3aC;
       c3aC:
           if ((old + 0) - <highSp> < SpLim) goto c3aI; else goto c3aJ;
       c3aI:
           R1 = _s2Rf::P64;
           call (stg_gc_enter_1)(R1) args: 8, res: 0, upd: 8;
       c3aJ:
           (_c3aE::I64) = call "ccall" arg hints:  [PtrHint,
                                                    PtrHint]  result hints:  [PtrHint] newCAF(BaseReg, _s2Rf::P64);
           if (_c3aE::I64 == 0) goto c3aG; else goto c3aF;
       c3aG:
           call (I64[_s2Rf::P64])() args: 8, res: 0, upd: 8;
       c3aF:
           I64[(old + 24)] = stg_bh_upd_frame_info;
           I64[(old + 16)] = _c3aE::I64;
           R3 = Main.flags_closure+2;
           R2 = Main.idx'_closure+1;
           R1 = GHC.Base.map_closure;
           call stg_ap_pp_fast(R3, R2, R1) args: 24, res: 0, upd: 24;
     }
 }]
```

Which basically means (closure names by me):

```haskell
map (idx_closure) (flags_closure)
```

So again, single function invocation, with closure parameters, and a lot of junk.

I'll spare you the details - when you know what to expect (i.e. a LOT of thunks), reversing is quite straightforward (except you need a LOT of, well, *patience*).

This is the reversed code, which should be **very** similar to the original:

```haskell
module Main where

import Data.Char

import Data.Function.Memoize

s0 = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!#$%&'\"()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~"

  forM_ (map idx flags) $ \i -> do
    putChar i
    hFlush stdout
```

Not a lot of code, for huge binary that it produced, eh?

The problem is simple - `idx` function is very slow. But we can make it faster. I was too *lazy* to rewrite everything to my usual language of choice (python), so I just implemented faster version of `idx` straight in haskell:

```haskell
fsize' :: Int -> Integer
fsize' 0 = fromIntegral $ length s0
fsize' i = 2 * fsize (i - 1) + 3 * fsize 0

fsize :: Int -> Integer
fsize = memoize fsize'

idx' :: Index -> Char
idx' (Index i j) =
    if i == 0 then s0 !! j
    else if fromIntegral j < fsize0 then s1 !! j
    else if fromIntegral j < fsize1 then idx' $ Index (i - 1) (j - fromInteger fsize0)
    else if fromIntegral j < fsize2 then s2 !! (j - fromInteger fsize1)
    else if fromIntegral j < fsize3 then idx' $ Index (i - 1) (j - fromInteger fsize2)
    else s3 !! (j - fromInteger fsize3)
    where fsize0 = fsize 0
          fsize1 = fsize0 + fsize (i - 1)
          fsize2 = fsize1 + fsize0
          fsize3 = fsize2 + fsize (i - 1)
```

And that's basically it - after running reversed version, correct flag is produced in seconds:

```
N1CTF{did_cmm_helped?1109ef6af4b2c6fc274ddc16ff8365d1}
```

PS. Yes, it did.
