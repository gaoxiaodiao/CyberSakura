Read with IDA. First, you can enter up to 9 characters in name. It seems that if you have a player and a hacker's HP, and if the player's HP is positive and you can make the hacker's HP negative, you will get a flag. There are Show menu, Firewall, and Battle options for each round. Firewall allows you to assign any int integer to defense. Defense is related to Battle, and the processing in the thread created by Battle changes depending on the value of defense. When defense is 1, hacker_hpFrom rand() % 0x1epull usleep(10)To do. When it is 2, hacker_hpSubtract 4 from usleep(10)To do. When 0, hacker_hpSubtract 3 from usleep(0)To do. In both cases, set the defense value to -1 after finishing. In Battle, you can assign your favorite int integer to defense while running the above process, rand() & 0b11Check if is equal to defense. If they are equal, you can prevent the attack. If they are not equal rand() & 0b11Depending on the value of player_hpSome is subtracted from. The round can be up to 200 times. Well, first srand(time(NULL))Since it is done, randomness can be predicted. So, I think that if you dodge the attack well and attack with a good feeling, you can defeat it.
