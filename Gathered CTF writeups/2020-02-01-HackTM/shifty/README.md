# Shifty (misc, 438p, 37 solved)

A rather nice challenge.
We basically get to play [Sixteen-Puzzle game](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/sixteen.html)

The goal is to write a solver for the game.
By playing it a bit we can notice that fixing all rows but the last one is pretty trivial.
We can do this following a kind-of insertion-sort approach.
We sort the blocks one-by-one in order.
Putting first is trivial, then putting every next block requires:

- Move the block `X` we want to put in place to be in the column next to target column
- Shift the target column down until the `X` and whatever is in the place we want to fill are next to each other
- Shift the row with `X` by one place, to put `X` in the correct column
- Shift the target column up until `X` in the right place

In case `X` is already in the correct row or column, we shift the column and/or row, before, so we get back to general case.

This allows us to fix all but the last row.

Fixing the last row is some voodoo-magic, but surprisingly it works!
The general idea is as follows:

- We take `X` and pivot it upwards
- We shift the last row until the target position is below `X`
- We put `X` in place by shifting its column downwards
- Now we have in the last row a single block which needs fixing
- We can fix it the same as we did in the first stage -> put it one column away from target, shift column downwards, shift row by 1 and shift column upwards

There is one special case here -> when there is inversion of last 2 blocks.
I didn't find a clear algorithm to fix this, but the approach which worked was:

- Perform the second stage algorithm to replace last block with first one
- If necessary perform whole solving algorithm one more time

Now in the game there were 5 stages with some twists:

1. Simple small game
2. Simple game with large board
3. Simple game with medium board but you can't see the board between moves. Doesn't matter for us since we solve it all at once anyway.
4. Now the controls are switched, eg shifting column `0` might shift `1` instead. We simply wrote a function which sent all possible rows and columns and observed which one actually moved. Then we "translated" the solution with this mapping.
5. The last stage is similar to 4 but this time like in 3 we can't see the board. This means we can't recover the mapping! But the board is small so we can brute-force it. We guess mapping, send the solution, and if the game was not solved, we send the inverted set of movements, to take board back to start position, and try again different mapping.
