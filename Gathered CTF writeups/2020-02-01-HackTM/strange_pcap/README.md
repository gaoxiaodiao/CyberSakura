# Strange pcap (for, 144p, 89 solved)

In the task we get a pcap to analyse.

There is some SCSI data transfer there, so we can use binwalk on the pcap to recover the transferred file.
It turns out to be an encrypted ZIP file.

The second part of the puzzle is at the end of the pcap.
There are some USB Interrupts with HID `3`, which indicated keyboard strokes.

We carve the data from pcap:

And we "borrow" some CTF code to decode the USB keycodes:

KEY_CODES = {

And we get back `7vgj4SSL9NHVuK0D6d3F`.
We use this as password on the ZIP and get `HackTM{88f1005c6b308c2713993af1218d8ad2ffaf3eb927a3f73dad3654dc1d00d4ae}`
