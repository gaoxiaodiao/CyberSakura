# hevc (Misc, 50pts, 217 solves)
	Welcome to the future.

This task was pretty simple if you notice its title. It turns out `hevc` is the name
of a pretty new video file format. With some googling, I was able to find
command converting it to other, more standard ones:
```
ffmpeg -i out.raw asd.avi
```
The video turns out to contain hand-written flag.
