# Cookie Monster Part 1

Points: 100

## Solution

What sticks out the most is this section of the source code:
```python
session = {
    'name': username,
    'role': 'users'
}
cipher = AES.new(key=current_app.config['KEY'], mode=AES.MODE_ECB)
cookie_data = json.dumps(session, separators=(',', ':'), sort_keys=True).encode('ascii', errors='replace')
return base64.b64encode(cipher.encrypt(pkcs7_pad(cookie_data)))
```

AES with ECB mode is [insecure](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/20946), and a
quick Google brings up some [similar
challenges](https://dr3dd.gitlab.io/cryptography/2018/10/11/Simple-Attack-On-AES-ECB-Mode/)
from other CTFs.

Our goal is to make sure that `role` is set to `administrators`. Oddly enough,
the other parts of this challenge all use `admin` instead of `administrators`,
so there might be some significance here.

Anyway, we need to make sure that when the cookie is decoded, it results in
valid JSON with the correct role. Here is the code responsible for the decoding:
```python
cipher = AES.new(key=current_app.config['KEY'], mode=AES.MODE_ECB)
cookie_data = pkcs7_unpad(cipher.decrypt(base64.b64decode(cookie)))
return json.loads(cookie_data.decode('ascii', errors='replace'))
```

In summary:
```
To encode:
- Put username into session object (with hardcoded `users` role)
- Create AES cipher using KEY (using ECB mode)
- Stringify session JSON
- PKCS7 pad stringified JSON
- Encrypt with AES cipher
- Base 64 encode

To decode:
- Create AES cipher using KEY (using ECB mode)
- Base 64 decode
- Decrypt with AES cipher
- PKCS7 unpad
- String to JSON
```

Due to the nature of AES, there's [no feasible
way](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/63889) to obtain the key even if we
have plaintext and ciphertext pairs. So it looks our only hope is to do some
hackery to find a ciphertext that decodes to the JSON we want.

AES-128 in EBC mode will encrypt 16 byte (128 bit) blocks at a time. Each block
is encrypted in isolation. So the same block of plaintext always generates the
block of ciphertext.

So if we wanted to find the ciphertext of this plaintext block
`1234567890123456`, we would need the website to encrypt it for us. If we gave
that ciphertext block back to the website, it will always decrypt back to
`1234567890123456`.

Now the trick is to come up with `name` values we can enter into the website
that will result in the plaintext blocks we want.

This turns out to be the hardest part. After playing around for a bit, it
actually seems impossible to create inputs that result in the plaintext blocks
we need. For example, one of the plaintext blocks we need is this:
```
administrators",
```

In order to obtain this block we need to supply a name like
`xxxxxx_administrators`:
```
1234567890123456
{"name":"xxxxxx_
administrators",
"role":"users"}
```

However, `xxxxxx_administrators` is 21 characters long, and the maximum allowed
length is 20. Now it seems impossible to generate any useful plaintext blocks. I
was stuck here for about 3 HOURS until I realized something about this line of
code:
```python
if 5 <= len(username) <= 20:
```

To calculate the length of a string, doesn't Python just count the number of
characters, regardless of whether they're ASCII or unicode? What happens if we
put in a ton of Unicode characters like `ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€`?
```
{"name":"\ud83d\
ude00\ud83d\ude0
0\ud83d\ude00\ud
83d\ude00\ud83d\
ude00\ud83d\ude0
0\ud83d\ude00\ud
83d\ude00\ud83d\
ude00\ud83d\ude0
0\ud83d\ude00\ud
83d\ude00\ud83d\
ude00\ud83d\ude0
0\ud83d\ude00\ud
83d\ude00\ud83d\
ude00\ud83d\ude0
0\ud83d\ude00\ud
83d\ude00","role
":"users"}
```

What the heck?? Each of these Unicode characters expands to 6 characters. That
means our new maximum is `20 * 6` which is `120`. Now we can get the plaintext
blocks we need by mixing in these unicode characters to increase the length of
the JSON. For example, with `æˆ‘_administrators`, we get:

```
{"name":"\u6211_
administrators", <- This is the block we want
"role":"users"}
```

Perfect! Now we have to find some other bits and pieces to create a valid JSON
string.

However, there's a big issue with double quotes. If we try to put in a `"` in
the input string, it gets escaped to `\"`. After getting stuck here for a few
more hours (I was trying to make Python accept single quotes, but that didn't
work), I realized that we could abuse whitespace to isolate a single character
in the plaintext block. Since JSON doesn't care about whitespace, it can still
be parsed without any issue.

After a lot of trial and error, I finally came up this list of plaintext blocks:
```
{"name":"xxxxxxx
xxxxxx","role":"
administrators",
"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
":              
"               
"               
}               
```

I had to include an extra `"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz": ""` key-value pair so that JSON
wouldn't complain about the comma after `administrators"`. Since the author told
`json.dumps` to sort the keys, we can guarantee that `zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz` will come
after `role`.

Next I had to come up with inputs that would result in these plaintext blocks.
These were:
```
xxxxxxx
æˆ‘_xxxxxx
æˆ‘_administrators
æˆ‘"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
æˆ‘":              
æˆ‘"               
æˆ‘_}               
æˆ‘_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

The last input was needed to generate a full row of padding that the `pkcs7_pad`
function would generate.

Plugging each of these inputs into the website, I recorded the cookie value in
`SESSIONID1`. I then wrote a script to process these cookie values and combine
the relevant blocks into one cookie to rule them all.

```python
import base64


def slice_block(ciphertext: bytes, index: int) -> bytes:
    block_size = 16
    start_i = block_size * index
    end_i = start_i + block_size
    return ciphertext[start_i:end_i]


def print_hex_blocks(ciphertext: bytes):
    for i in range(len(ciphertext)):
        b = ciphertext[i:i+1]
        print(b.hex(), end='')

        if i > 0:
            if (i + 1) % 16 == 0:
                print()
            elif (i + 1) % 2 == 0:
                print(end=' ')
