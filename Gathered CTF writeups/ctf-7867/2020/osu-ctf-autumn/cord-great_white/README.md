You can open this file in Wireshark, which will show a bunch of packets. We
have some HTTP packets, so after some googling around, I realized that you
could do `File -> Export Exports -> HTTP`, which would allow you export several
files including `flag.png` to a separate folder. Opening `flag.png` shows an
image with this text: `osuctf{p4ck3ts_4r3_c00L}`
