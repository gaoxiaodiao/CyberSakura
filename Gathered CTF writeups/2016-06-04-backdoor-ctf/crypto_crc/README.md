# CRC

In this task we were given 26 encrypted zip files. It is easy to notice though, that they have
very small size - they uncompress to 5 byte files. That means we should be able to brute force
the actual contents, and check their validity using crc, since ZIPs contain CRC32 of 
their uncompressed contents:
```
[adam@adam-Y510P ~/CTF/backdoor/zipcrc]Î» unzip -lv 0.zip
Archive:  0.zip
 Length   Method    Size  Cmpr    Date    Time   CRC-32   Name
--------  ------  ------- ---- ---------- ----- --------  ----
       5  Stored        5   0% 2015-11-26 19:49 a36bb2ae  0.txt
--------          -------  ---                            -------
       5                5   0%                            1 file
```
We listed all CRCs in `list`, and wrote a brute forcer - `check.cpp`. It looped over all printable
5-character strings and calculated its CRC, after which it checked whether it fits any zip.

Unfortunately there were many collisions, so we wrote a quick visualizer showing possibilites
for each zip (`parse.py`). Output:
```

We quickly noticed it should be a PHP code (`<?php` in the first block gives it away). Connecting
the dots, we manually created the script:
```
function func() { 
	echo "The Flag: "; 
	for($i = 0; $i<32; $i++) 
		echo chr(0x41 + (($i ^ 0x12) % 0x19)); 
	echo "\n"; 
} 
func();
```
After running it, we got the flag.
