In this task, we got just the encrypted, hex-encoded file. It was easy to see some patterns were repeating, such as
`qEdocBqhc` or `8dwnel`. If we read them backwards, they are `chqBcodEq` and `lenwd8`, respectively, which seem similar
to `charCode` or `length` - some JavaScript function names - which seemed good, so we reversed the whole ciphertext. 
We found a couple of such ciphertext-plaintext pairs and noticed
that the lower nibbles of the character never changes - for example, `q` (ASCII 0x71) from `chqBcodE` was changed to `a`
(ASCII 0x61). We wrote an [interactive brute forcer](interactive.py), which allowed us to recover a couple
dozens of plaintext bytes:
```
`ufa,(hvensdio.(y{fq"p:];8)<7 <6 <8%<8'<9$<9 <7!<7$<8 <7)<8(<7&<8!<7%<6%<6&<8&<8"<7R={fq"p1][
 eval((function(){var j=[89,70,60,85,87,94,90,71,74,80,79,88,76,81,75,65,66,86,82,7B];var a=[
```
If we write higher nibble of ciphertext, of plaintext, and of their xor, we will get something like this:
```
`ufa,(hvensdio.(y{fq"p:];8)<7 <6 <8%<8'<9$<9 <7!<7$<8 <7)<8(<7&<8!<7%<6%<6&<8&<8"<7R={fq"p1][
 eval((function(){var j=[89,70,60,85,87,94,90,71,74,80,79,88,76,81,75,65,66,86,82,7B];var a=[

```
We can notice a pattern: lower row is xor of last two numbers on top row. With this in mind, we wrote a [script](solv.py)
to decrypt the whole file.

The decrypted file was the following script (after unpacking and unminifying):
```javascript
var _$_ddec = [ "toString", "charCodeAt", "length", "0", "map", "", "split", "join", "fromCharCode", "max", "log", "dctfizer", "undctfizer", "So what exactly do you want?" ];
 
function goToHex(b) {
    var c = b["split"]("")["map"](function(d) {
        var e = d["charCodeAt"](0)["toString"](16);
        return e["length"] == 1 ? "0" + e : e;
    });
    return c["join"]("");
}
 
function backFromHex(b) {
    var c = "";
    for (var a = 0; a < b["length"]; a += 2) {
        c += String["fromCharCode"](parseInt(b[a] + b[a + 1], 16));
    }
    return c;
}
 
function memoryGood(b, l) {
    var f = [];
    var g = 0;
    for (var a = 0; a < 234; a++) {
        f[a] = a;
    }
    for (a = 0; a < Math["max"](234, b["length"]); a++) {
        var h = l["charCodeAt"](a);
        l += String["fromCharCode"]((h << 1 | h >> 7) & 255);
    }
    console["log"](l["charCodeAt"](4));
    for (a = 0; a < 234; a++) {
        g = (g + f[a] + l["charCodeAt"](a)) % 234;
        f[a] ^= f[g];
        f[g] ^= f[a];
        f[a] ^= f[g];
    }
    a = g = 0;
    result = "";
    for (var m = 0; m < b["length"]; m++) {
        a = (a + 1) % 234;
        g = (g + f[a]) % 234;
        f[a] ^= f[g];
        f[g] ^= f[a];
        f[a] ^= f[g];
        var n = f[(f[a] + f[g]) % 234];
        var o = l["charCodeAt"](m);
        result = result + String["fromCharCode"](n ^ b["charCodeAt"](m) ^ o);
    }
    return result;
}
 
function proceed(b, l, p) {
    if (p == "dctfizer") {
        cipherText = memoryGood(b, l);
        return goToHex(cipherText);
    } else {
        if (p == "undctfizer") {
            plainText = memoryGood(backFromHex(b), l);
            return plainText;
        }
    }
    return "So what exactly do you want?";
}
```

This is a modified RC4 algorithm.
In this code we can see a vulnerability in key expansion algorithm:

```javascript
    for (a = 0; a < Math["max"](234, b["length"]); a++) {
        var h = l["charCodeAt"](a);
        l += String["fromCharCode"]((h << 1 | h >> 7) & 255);
    }
```

The key is basically rotating, so if the first byte was `1100` then the first byte of extended key part would be `1001` and in the next round `0011` and so on. 
This means that if we could extract a single bit position of the key, with enough ciphertext length we could extract the whole key.
However the code here was broken because `% 234` does not leave any bit position intact (maybe they wanted to do `& 234`?).
We contacted admins and they admited that it was a mistake and it should have been `128` and not `234`, which basically coverges this task to the same problem as here:

https://github.com/p4-team/ctf/tree/master/2015-11-20-dctffinals/crypto300#eng-version

Because now the MSB of all of the XORed elements is 0 apart from the one from key, so we can extract all MSB bits from ciphertext and combine them to recover the key (we need to brute-force the key length as well but the range is small).
