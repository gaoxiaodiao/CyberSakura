# SCS CTF 2018

Team: msm, rev, nazywam, rodbert, sasza, chivay, des, eternal, psrok1

### Table of contents

* [binary (re)](re_binary)
* [xors (crypto)](crypto_xor)
* [rots (crypto)](crypto_rot)
* [serialize (web)](web_serialize)

### Notes:

Actually there was a 3-person limit for a team, so we started as three separate teams:

- p4-indigo: msm, rev, nazywam
- p4-lime: rodbert, sasza, chivay
- p4-orange: des, eternal, psrok1

Also I don't remember the original task names, so I had to invent my own.
