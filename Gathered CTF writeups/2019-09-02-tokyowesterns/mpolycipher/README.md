# M-Poly-Cipher (re/crypto, 279p, 26 solved)

In the challenge we get [a binary](cipher) to reverse.
We also get a [public key](public.key) and [encrypted flag](flag.enc).
After hours of blood, sweat and tears we finally reach a [working python implementation](code.py).

The key part is:

```python
def encrypt(pt_file: str, pk_file: str, result_file: str) -> None:
    with open(pt_file, 'rb') as ctf:
        pt = ctf.read()
        pt = (pt + b'\x00' * (0x40 - len(pt)))[:0x40]
        pt = deserialise_vectors8(pt)

    with open(pk_file, 'rb') as pkf:
        pk = pkf.read()
        pk0 = parse_vectors(pk[0:256])
        pk1 = parse_vectors(pk[256:512])
        pk2 = parse_vectors(pk[512:768])

    seed = get_random_vectors()
    stage0 = matrix_mult(seed, pk0)
    stage1 = matrix_mult(seed, pk1)
    stage2 = matrix_mult(seed, pk2)
    combined = add_rows(stage2, pt)

    result = b''
    result += serialise_vectors32(stage0)
    result += serialise_vectors32(stage1)
    result += serialise_vectors32(combined)

    with open(result_file, 'wb') as outf:
        outf.write(result)
```

This shows what is the relation between public key we have and the encrypted output.
We didn't even try to understand the private key generation, we decided it will be far easier to simply reverse the encryption process.

It's quite clear that we need to invert `add_rows` operation on third output chunk, and this would give us plaintext.
In order to do that we need the `seed` vector.
We don't know it, however we know the `stage0` and `stage1` vectors.
And those are created from some matrix multiplication based on `pk0` and `pk2`, which we know!

So the idea is to invert the `matrix_mult` operation to recover the `seed`, and then use seed to invert `add_rows`.

What we got as matrix_mult is:

```python
def matrix_mult(data: List[int], key: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for j in range(8):
        for i in range(8):
            val = 0
            for k in range(8):
                val = (val + (data[j * 8 + k] * key[k * 8 + i])) % 0xFFFFFFFB
            result.append(val)
    return result
```

Which is not very readable, so we asked sage to show us the actual matrix:

```python
def matrix_mult(data, key):
    result = []
    for j in range(8):
        for i in range(8):
            val = 0
            for k in range(8):
                val = (val + (data[j * 8 + k] * key[k * 8 + i]))
            result.append(val)
    return result

seed_sym = [var('s' + str(i)) for i in range(64)]
pk_sym = [var('pk' + str(i)) for i in range(64)]

print(matrix_mult(seed_sym, pk_sym))
```

And we got back:

```

```

This is how `stage0` and `stage1` are calculated from `pk0` and `pk1` combined with `seed`.
Now we want to find such matrix `M0` that `M0*seed = stage0`.

The matrix we want is:

```

We come up with:

```python
def matrix_mult2(seed, pk):
    pkm = Matrix(Zmod(mod), [[0 for i in range(8*k)]+[pk[i] for i in range(j,64,8)]+[0 for i in range(8*(8-k-1))] for k in range(8) for j in range(8)])
    return list(pkm*vector(seed))
```

And it works exactly as we wanted.
Now we could just do:

```python
def recover_seed(result, pk):
    pkm = Matrix(Zmod(mod), [[0 for i in range(8*k)]+[pk[i] for i in range(j,64,8)]+[0 for i in range(8*(8-k-1))] for k in range(8) for j in range(8)])
    result_matrix = pkm.solve_right(vector(result))
    return list(result_matrix)
```

In order to recover the seed.
But it turned out the results are ambigious and for `pk0` and `stage0` we get different results than for `pk1` and `stage1`.
Fortunately we can combine those equations in a single system and solve at once, hopefully getting a single result:

```python
def recover_seed2(stage0, stage1, pk0, pk1):
    m1 = [[0 for i in range(8*k)]+[pk0[i] for i in range(j,64,8)]+[0 for i in range(8*(8-k-1))] for k in range(8) for j in range(8)]
    m2 = [[0 for i in range(8*k)]+[pk1[i] for i in range(j,64,8)]+[0 for i in range(8*(8-k-1))] for k in range(8) for j in range(8)]
    m = m1+m2
    pkm = Matrix(Zmod(mod), m)
    result_matrix = pkm.solve_right(vector(stage0+stage1))
    return list(result_matrix)
```

And from this we actually manage to recover the `seed`:

```
[3437097476, 1872232232, 3647344144, 3900179940, 289303261, 1125306664, 1781119250, 2685999413, 2926201689, 1794057147, 3762873198, 518522290, 3146643550, 2401122808, 2576451253, 4054234528, 2639110757, 2257625570, 2726372255, 909523980, 3279957714, 11808025, 2748448837, 3248636903, 1862461456, 2863118810, 2029738056, 204000072, 1150709971, 1366849197, 3380682274, 4048488032, 561673885, 2638095422, 604494451, 3029286890, 2174284642, 1281120732, 4271766672, 1413542622, 1380470061, 336824337, 4227867279, 49513556, 3316972952, 158722238, 2577376715, 1836198972, 1517374624, 2154122694, 2020093710, 3727061870, 1719521710, 4187510087, 4057609046, 3434783742, 1108797172, 61803915, 4134164703, 989888949, 2202917742, 2375475319, 626659464, 3913729267]
```

Now we can just calculate `stage2` by `stage2 = matrix_mult(seed, pk2)` and then invert `add_rows(stage2, pt)`:

```python
    recovered_seed = recover_seed2(stage0, stage1, pk0, pk1)    
    print('seed', recovered_seed)
    stage2 = matrix_mult(recovered_seed, pk2)
    print('stage2', stage2)
    
    ptr = sub_rows(combined, stage2)
    print("".join(map(chr,ptr)))
```
